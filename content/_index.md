        Robert J. Dellinger is a Ph.D. student in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, specializing in biogeochemistry, under the mentorship of Dr. Aradhna Tripati. Rob's research explores the interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming on marine organisms by assessing their physiological responses to projected climate change scenarios. By employing mechanistic approaches, they aim to predict how changes at the organismal level could scale up to influence broader ecosystem functions.
