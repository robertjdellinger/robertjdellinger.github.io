      text: |-
        I am a PhD student in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, where I investigate the interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming on marine organisms. My work explores how organisms respond physiologically to projected climate change scenarios, and how these changes might scale up to influence broader ecosystem functions.

        Using both ecological and biogeochemical techniques, I aim to understand how shifts in ecological processes will ultimately impact human society. I apply a Critical Ecology Framework to examine how structural inequalities drive environmental changes and biogeochemical cycles.
