      text: |
        Robert J. Dellinger is a Ph.D. student in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, specializing in biogeochemistry. Their research integrates multi-proxy coral geochemistry with ancient DNA metabarcoding to reconstruct centennial-scale impacts of climate variability and land-use change on marine ecosystems, with implications for predicting how ecological shifts will impact human society.
