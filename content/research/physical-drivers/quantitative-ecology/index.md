## Introduction

Investigating how interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming influence organismal energetics and thermal performance in marine invertebrates.

## Methods

Mesocosm experiments combined with respirometry and thermal performance curve analysis to quantify metabolic responses across environmental gradients.

## Findings

Ocean acidification alters thermal performance metrics and increases energetic demand in marine invertebrates, with implications for species distributions under climate change.

## Why it matters

Understanding physiological constraints under multiple stressors is essential for predicting community-level responses to climate change and informing marine resource management.
