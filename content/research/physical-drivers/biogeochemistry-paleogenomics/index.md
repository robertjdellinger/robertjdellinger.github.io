## Introduction

Investigating coral biomineralization processes and symbiont community dynamics using integrated approaches combining multi-proxy geochemistry with ancient DNA analysis.

## Methods

Multi-proxy analytical techniques including stable isotope geochemistry, trace element analysis, and paleogenomic reconstruction from coral skeletal archives.

## Findings

Key results examining how environmental variability affects coral calcification and symbiont associations across temporal scales.

## Why it matters

Understanding coral responses to environmental change is critical for predicting future reef trajectories and informing conservation strategies in the face of climate change and local stressors.
