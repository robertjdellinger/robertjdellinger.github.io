      text: |
        In the **Gold Lab** at Bodega Marine Laboratory I studied the early evolution of animal life, 
        particularly genes related to **biomineralization** and geochemical biomarkers in **Cnidaria** 
        (corals, jellyfish, and anemones) using molecular paleontology techniques.
        
        I investigated **moon jellyfish** (_Aurelia aurita_) as a model organism to understand cell type 
        evolution, tissue regeneration mechanisms, and developmental biology.
        
        I also investigated the physiological and genetic mechanisms of **anoxia tolerance** and 
        **regeneration**, contributing to the understanding of evolutionary adaptations to hypoxic marine 
        environments.
