      title: "The Bay Lab"
      text: |
        In the **Bay Lab** at UC Davis I supported coral husbandry, participated in a faculty
        reading group, and contributed to a **meta analysis** on environmental and anthropogenic
        drivers of genetic diversity in **_Acropora_**. Early results indicated **pH** had the
        strongest association with genetic diversity, and **_A. palmata_** in the Caribbean showed
        notably high diversity, suggesting species specific baselines and stressor sensitivities.
