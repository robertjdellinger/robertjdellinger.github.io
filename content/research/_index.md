      title: "Biophysical Drivers of Environmental Change"
      text: |
        **Biogeochemistry & Paleogenomics Research**  
        My doctoral research at UCLA integrates multi-proxy geochemistry with ancient DNA methods to investigate coral biomineralization and symbiont community dynamics. I examine how climate variability and coastal land use change affect coral-algal symbioses, using clumped isotope thermometry, trace element analysis, and environmental DNA preserved in coral skeletons. This work aims to reconstruct past ecosystem states and improve predictions of coral reef responses to ongoing environmental change.

        **Quantitative Ecology Research**  
        During my Master's research at CSUN, I investigated how ocean acidification and warming interactively affect the energetics of the marine snail *Tegula funebralis*. Using respirometry and thermal performance curve analysis, I demonstrated that acidification shifts thermal optima and increases energetic costs across a range of temperatures. This work quantified physiological constraints that may limit species' abilities to adapt to multiple climate stressors, with implications for rocky intertidal community structure along the California coast.

        **Critical Ecology Research**  
        As a Graduate Research Assistant at Vassar College's Critical Ecology Lab, I examined how industrial emissions, segregation policies, and economic inequality shaped acid rain impacts on forest biogeochemistry in the northeastern United States. Integrating historical redlining maps, atmospheric chemistry models, and long-term ecological data from Hubbard Brook LTER, I traced how structural inequalities influenced the spatial distribution of environmental stressors and subsequent ecosystem responses. This work demonstrates that understanding ecological change requires attention to the social and political forces that structure landscapes.

        **Policy-Driven Scientific Research**  
        My applied research experience spans environmental compliance and natural resource damage assessment. As a Senior Environmental Technician at Eco-Alpha Environmental Services, I managed water quality monitoring programs ensuring regulatory compliance for industrial and municipal clients. During an internship at NOAA Fisheries, I conducted histopathological analyses of white perch from the Passaic River Superfund site, contributing evidence for natural resource damage assessments. Through NSF's Sustainable Oceans program, I developed community-engaged research projects addressing stakeholder-identified priorities in coastal California.

      text: |
        ### Bay Lab, 2019 to 2021
        **Population Genomics & Coral Adaptation**  
        Supported coral husbandry and contributed to meta-analysis on environmental and anthropogenic drivers of genetic diversity in *Acropora* corals at UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory. Early results indicated pH had the strongest association with genetic diversity, with species-specific patterns suggesting differential stressor sensitivities.

        ### Bodega Marine Laboratory, Gold Lab, 2019
        **Molecular Paleontology, Geobiology, Ecotoxicology**  
        Independently researched microplastic ingestion in white urchin larvae, demonstrating feeding mechanisms, inability to discriminate polystyrene particles, and potential for hydrophobic compound accumulation. Collaborated on comparative genomics of Cnidaria and conducted a six-week hypoxia experiment showing reduced regeneration frequency in *Aurelia aurita* under low oxygen conditions.

        ### Study Abroad Research, 2017
        **Wetland Ecology & Community Science**  
        Investigated invasive *Hydrilla* impacts on water quality and native macrophytes at Lake Atitlán, Guatemala. Combined field sampling, mesocosm experiments, and stakeholder interviews to assess efficacy of macrophyte-based eutrophication mitigation. Demonstrated bioaccumulation benefits but competitive displacement of natives, sharing recommendations with local agencies in Spanish.
