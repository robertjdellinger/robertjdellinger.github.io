        My current research focuses on how coral biomineralization and symbiotic community structure respond to long-term climate variability and anthropogenic land-use change. My research integrates sub-annual coral geochemistry (Sr/Ca, δ¹⁸O, δ¹¹B, Ba/Ca, Δ¹⁴C) with ancient DNA (coraDNA) metabarcoding of coral symbionts to reconstruct the centennial-scale impacts of warming, ocean acidification, and nutrient loading in the Banda Islands, Indonesia. This study represents the first high-resolution paleoclimate reconstruction to directly link centennial-scale environmental change to shifts in Symbiodiniaceae community composition in response to climate variability and coastal disturbance.

        My previous research examined how ocean warming and acidification interact to influence the physiological energetics of Tegula funebralis, a common intertidal sea snail. Along the Pacific West Coast, T. funebralis is highly abundant and plays a key ecological role as a macroalgal grazer—facilitating energy transfer from primary producers to higher trophic levels-a foundational interaction that structures energy flow throughout marine food webs. In dynamic intertidal zones, T. funebralis experiences substantial seasonal and diurnal temperature fluctuations that directly influence metabolic rates (e.g, increased temperatures, elevate grazing activity). As oceans continue to warm and acidify due to anthropogenic climate change, understanding how these co-occurring stressors affect the metabolic performance of key herbivores is essential for predicting broader ecosystem responses. Therefore, this study asked: How does ocean acidification impact energetic expenditure across a range of ecologically relevant temperatures experienced by Tegula funebralis?

        In collaboration with the Critical Ecology Lab and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (NSF LTER), this study examined how structural inequality has shaped the origins of acid rain by analyzing whether historical segregation and present-day social vulnerability influence the spatial distribution of NOₓ and SO₂-emitting facilities in states that contribute disproportionately to acid deposition. Geospatial analysis assessed whether these facilities were disproportionately located in formerly redlined neighborhoods, as designated by the U.S. Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), and whether current emissions were concentrated in areas with elevated vulnerability, based on the CDC Social Vulnerability Index. Emissions data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) and National Emissions Inventory (NEI) were used to calculate average annual NOₓ and SO₂ emissions per facility across HOLC grades. Lower-graded (C and D) neighborhoods not only hosted the highest number of facilities but also exhibited the highest average emissions per facility, indicating a disproportionate pollution burden in historically segregated and socially vulnerable communities. These findings illustrate how land-use legacies and exclusionary planning practices continue to shape the geography of environmental harm. The results also elucidate that addressing inequality is not only a matter of justice but a necessary intervention in the very places where pollution is most concentrated; in other words, redressing social and spatial inequities can simultaneously challenge the structural conditions that produce both social and environmental harm. Consequently, by linking spatial emissions data to indicators of inequality, this project contributes to broader efforts to understand how long-term ecological change is shaped by political and economic power.
