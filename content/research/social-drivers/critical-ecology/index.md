## Introduction

Examining the interconnections between historical discriminatory housing practices (redlining), industrial facility siting, and contemporary environmental inequalities in pollution exposure and ecosystem health.

## Methods

Integration of historical policy analysis, atmospheric chemistry modeling, and social vulnerability indices with biogeochemical assessments to trace environmental legacies.

## Findings

Historical patterns of segregation and industrial development have created persistent biogeochemical signatures in urban and peri-urban ecosystems, with ongoing impacts on human and ecosystem health.

## Why it matters

Understanding the social origins of environmental degradation is essential for developing just remediation strategies and preventing perpetuation of environmental inequalities.
