      text: |
        *Publication available at the Bodega Marine Laboratory, Cadet Library.*

        **Dellinger, R. 2019.** *Patterns and Consequences of Microplastic Ingestion by
        Larval Stages of the White Urchin, Lytechinus pictus.*

        At UC Davis BML I independently researched microplastic consumption in marine larvae
        with **Dr. Gary Cherr**, focusing on feeding behavior, inability to discriminate
        polystyrene particles, and hydrophobic compounds as vectors for pathogens.
        Confocal microscopy work outlined mechanisms by which microplastics threaten larvae,
        and suggested benthic engineers may serve as biomonitors of microplastic pollution.
