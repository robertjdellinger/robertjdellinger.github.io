      text: |
        As part of a UC Davis study abroad program I conducted research at **Lake Atitlán**
        with **Dr. Eliska Rejmánková** and **Dr. Jenise Snyder**. The lake is iconic,
        yet altered by nutrient loading, land use change, tourism pressure, and climate impacts,
        including the 2008 **_Lyngbya robusta_** bloom.

      title: "Project and findings"
      text: |
        We tested how invasive **_Hydrilla_** affects water quality and native plants using
        field sampling and mesocosms, focusing on pelagic profiles, population densities and
        diversity, and macrophyte efficacy for reducing eutrophication. *Hydrilla* improved some
        water chemistry through high N, P, and As bioaccumulation, but outcompeted natives.
        We added **stakeholder and Indigenous community interviews** and shared recommendations
        with local agencies, strengthening Spanish-language science communication.
