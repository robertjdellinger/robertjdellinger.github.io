<!-- TODO: Add R code demonstrating:
     - Opening NetCDF file with ncdf4
     - Extracting variables and spatial extent
     - Creating maps with oce package
     - Visualizing oceanographic data
     Example workflow with satellite SST, chlorophyll, or other ocean data
-->

This post will demonstrate how to work with satellite oceanographic data in R using the `oce` and `ncdf4` packages. Content coming soon.
