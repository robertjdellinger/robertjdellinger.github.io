# Publications Directory

This directory contains publication entries for the website.

## Current Status

The example publications (journal-article, conference-paper, preprint) are template files and should be replaced with actual publications.

## Adding Your Publications

1. Create a new folder for each publication (e.g., `dellinger-2024-coral-oa/`)
2. Add an `index.md` file with publication metadata
3. Optionally add images (featured.jpg/png) and supplementary files
4. Set `featured: true` for publications you want highlighted on the homepage

## Publication Metadata

Include:
- Title, authors, date
- Publication venue (journal, conference, etc.)
- Abstract and summary
- DOI, arXiv, or other identifiers
- Links to PDF, code, data, etc.
- Tags for categorization
