      username: "admin"
      text: |
        I am a PhD student in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, where I investigate how physical and social forces shape environmental change. My research integrates multi-proxy geochemistry with ancient DNA to understand coral biomineralization and symbiont community dynamics under climate variability and coastal land use change. I am committed to translating science into policy and community action, centering justice-oriented perspectives in environmental research.
