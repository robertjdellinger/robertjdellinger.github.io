Robert J. Dellinger (he/they) is a Ph.D. student in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UCLA, specializing in biogeochemistry, under the mentorship of Dr. Aradhna Tripati. Rob previously earned a Master of Science degree in Biology from California State University, Northridge, as a researcher in the Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab. They also hold dual bachelor's degrees in, Marine and Coastal Science (B.S.) and International Relations (B.A.) from UC Davis. Rob's research explores the interactive effects of ocean acidification and warming on marine organisms by assessing their physiological responses to projected climate change scenarios. By employing mechanistic approaches, they aim to predict how changes at the organismal level could scale up to influence broader ecosystem functions. Furthermore, by utilzing both ecological and biogeochemical techniques, they aim to understand how shifts in ecological processes will ultimately impact human society. Currently, Robert is honored to be a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow, UCLA Center for Diverse leadership Fellow, and a Sustainable Oceans NSF National Research Trainee. I am also committed furthering access to higher education and all levels of academia for individuals from diverse and underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds. Academia and knowledge should be accessible to all whom have the curiosity to explore them.
