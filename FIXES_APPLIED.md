# Repository Fixes Applied

This document summarizes all fixes applied to resolve issues in the Hugo/Hugo Blox website.

## Date: 2025-10-31

## Critical Fixes (Build-Breaking) ✅

### 1. Missing Research Folders
- **Issue**: `content/research/_index.md` referenced non-existent folders causing collection failures
- **Fix**: Created missing folders with proper `_index.md` files:
  - `content/research/phd/_index.md` - PhD research placeholder
  - `content/research/masters/_index.md` - Masters research placeholder
- **Impact**: Collections will now render properly without errors

### 2. Demo Content Removed
- **Issue**: Homepage contained demo CTA block (line 102) not intended for production
- **Fix**: Removed entire `cta-card` demo block from `content/_index.md`
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more professional homepage without Hugo Blox promotional content

## Front Matter & SEO Fixes ✅

### 3. Added `draft: false` to All Content
- **Issue**: Many content files lacked explicit `draft: false` field

  - Gallery summary: Reduced from 167 to 107 characters
  - Contact summary: Optimized for clarity and length (106 characters)
- **Impact**: Better SEO performance and search result snippets

## Accessibility Improvements ✅

### 5. Enhanced Image Alt Text
- **Issue**: Gallery images had minimal alt text descriptions
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive alt text and enhanced captions for:
  - Marine Invertebrates gallery
  - Coastal Landscapes gallery
  - Coral Research gallery
- **Impact**: Improved screen reader support and accessibility compliance

## Configuration Fixes ✅

### 6. Resolved Robots.txt Conflict
- **Issue**: Both Hugo auto-generated and manual `static/robots.txt` existed
- **Fix**: Removed manual `static/robots.txt` to prevent conflicts
- **Impact**: Hugo will now properly generate robots.txt with sitemap reference

### Deleted Files (1 file)
18. `static/robots.txt` - Removed to prevent conflict

## Issues NOT Fixed (By Design)

### Empty Collections
- **Status**: NOT FIXED - Intentional
- **Reason**: These are placeholder sections for future content:
  - Events folder (will contain conference/talk entries)
  - Projects folder (will contain research projects)
  - Courses folder (will contain teaching materials)
- **Recommendation**: Populate with content or hide sections in menu when ready

### Math Feature Disabled
- **Status**: NOT FIXED - Intentional
- **Reason**: No mathematical equations currently used in content
- **Recommendation**: Enable in `params.yaml` if KaTeX equations are needed
